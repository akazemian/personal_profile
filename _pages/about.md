Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student at Stanford University co-advised by <a href="https://lauragwilliams.github.io/">Dr. Laura Gwilliams</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~yamins/">Dr. Dan Yamins</a>. I'm broadly interested in questions at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, particularly how the brain transforms continuous sensory input into higher-level discrete symbols and how these principles can inspire the development of more powerful AI models.

Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked with <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> on understanding the representations and algorithms of primate visual cortex by studying the properties of high dimensional untrained vision models. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Integrated Engineering from the University of British Columbia.
