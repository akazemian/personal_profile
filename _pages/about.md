Hi!

I’m a first year PhD student at Stanford Univesity. I'm interested in how humans process sensory information give rise to higher level concepts and meaning, and to develop AI that emulates this ability more efficiently. Currently, I'm working with my advisors <a href="https://lauragwilliams.github.io/">Dr. Laura Gwilliams</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~yamins/">Dr. Dan Yamins</a> on deep learning models of speech and language. 

Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked with <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> on understanding the representations and algorithms of primate visual cortex by studying the properties of high dimensional untrained vision models. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Integrated Engineering from the University of British Columbia.
